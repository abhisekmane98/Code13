Changes via a can be observed via b.

Once b is destroyed, a.name is a dangling pointer.

If a is destroyed, deleting the dangling pointer yields undefined behavior.

Since the assignment does not take into account what name pointed to before the assignment, 
sooner or later you will get memory leaks all over the place.
